## Module 20 Challenge Files

This repo contains the following,
- The main Credit Risk directory containing the Credit Risk Classification Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) as well as a markdown file containing my analysis (.md), and
- The Resources directory containing my loan data in a CSV format

In this Challenge, I've used two supervised learning methods to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Our given dataset contains historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company that I will use to build said models that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. You will find more information in my Analysis report linked [here]([url](https://github.com/nivethasund/credit-risk-classification/blob/main/Credit_Risk/credit_risk_analysis.md)https://github.com/nivethasund/credit-risk-classification/blob/main/Credit_Risk/credit_risk_analysis.md)
